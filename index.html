        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been informed by some close associations that Edward Abbey is being considered for the professorial position available in the English Department at UCR. This is interestingly sudden, yet I am glad that he is being offered the position and think that he would be a welcome addition to the world-class faculty that the school already possesses. I also believe that since the specific position that Mr. Abbey is being considered for warrants a strong skillset in writing about our natural environment and the wilderness, he is particularly qualified and preferred. Primarily, Mr. Abbey displays absolute primacy in his authorship on nature and one does not need to travel any further than his book covering his experiences as a ranger at Arches National Park. Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness is absolutely packed with expansive and emotive descriptions of nature, these of which not only display his immense passion for writing, but also his inclination towards a more environmentally balanced way of life for us all. Mr. Abbey‚Äôs environmentalist leanings are vital today where we as an institution must represent the movement within the academic community, and with our success lying in the people we choose to represent the institution. To demonstrate Mr. Abbey‚Äôs duty to his craft I will delve into and explore a couple of samples from his novel, and in this way present him to any of the members who have not read his work. 
	Edward Abbey displays a unique passion for writing about the wilderness that many young writers may find themselves inspired and moved by, and his descriptions of nature‚Äôs wonders are something to aspire towards. One passage that particularly highlights his specific style and perception on nature, in this case the Colorado River, can be found within the book‚Äôs twelfth chapter and goes as such, ‚ÄúThe living river and the living river alone gives coherence and significance and therefore beauty to the canyon world.‚Äù This passage describes an appreciation and a high level of respect for what nature has created, and its dedicated tone proves Abbey‚Äôs commitment to not only writing in a fashion which invokes thought, but also displays his strong environmentalist perception. In fact, in its entirety, Desert Solitaire is a book filled with viewpoints such as these, and this is important since we as an institution are committed to similar dedications. Abbey‚Äôs opposition to the dam on the Colorado River also proves his understanding of how industrialization and modernization can oftentimes be entirely at odds with a healthy natural environment and ecosystem. With our current, somewhat drastic circumstances, we must begin to seriously consider what kind of effect universities and educational institutions have on the public‚Äôs perception of environmental movements and the conservation of earth‚Äôs wildernesses. 
	In the final chapter of his book, Abbey describes his conversation with a ‚Äúvisitor‚Äù to the park and within this exchange he makes it clear that his perceptions are both unique yet exactly what I think this university needs right now. Some may read his book and similarly to the visitor, deem him ‚Äúagainst civilization‚Ä¶[and] against humanity.‚Äù Yet this is an unfair and uninformed perception of his work, and Abbey clarifies that he is merely not man centered. His description of the exchange is followed by a subtle tirade against the ‚Äúmisapplied‚Äù nature of modern science, where he grounds his belief as a kind that is dedicated to scientific ‚Äútechnique and technology,‚Äù but not infected with a romantic and unrealistic view of science, a view of which he calls ‚Äúscientism.‚Äù To finalize my brief exploration into Mr. Abbey‚Äôs book, I invite any of those on the committee to attempt to criticize his viewpoint on humanity‚Äôs relationship with the natural environment, while keeping in mind that we humans have led to many tragedies since the arrival of the industrial revolution.
